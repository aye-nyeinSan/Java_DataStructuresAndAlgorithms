  ```


#### 2. Enable Circle comparable) Rewrite the given Circle class to extend given GeometricObject and implement the Comparable interface. Override the equals method in the Object class. Two Circle objects are equal if their radii are the same. Draw the UML diagram that involves Circle, GeometricObject, and Comparable.
